    and/or Beta Products (defined below) offered on a preliminary, evaluation or “beta” testing basis.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Please read the Terms of Use carefully before You start to use the Beta Products. <strong>By using the Beta
      Products and intending to be legally bound hereby, You accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of
      Use and Our <a href="/doc/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, incorporated herein by reference.</strong> If
    You do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the <a href="/doc/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, You must not access or use the Beta Products.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Scope of Terms of Use</strong></p>
  <p>Tester is being granted rights under this Terms of Use for the purpose of testing and providing input and other
    Feedback (defined below)to the Company regarding one or more of the Company’s proprietary, non-commercially
    available services and/or Beta Products on a temporary basis (individually and collectively, the “<strong>Beta
      Products</strong>”). This Terms of Use covers all Beta Products made available to Tester by the Company,
    including, without limitation, any Beta Products specifically identified by the Company as being in a preliminary,
    evaluation, “beta” or any similar state of development. The Company retains sole and absolute discretion over the
    Beta Products and may modify them at any time. Tester’s use of and access to such Beta Products is subject to the
    terms of this Terms of Use.</p>
  <p><strong>Limited Use Rights</strong></p>
  <p>For the duration of this Terms of Use, the Company hereby grants Tester a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    non-sublicensable, revocable, limited license to allow Tester’s designated participants to use the Beta Products to
    test their functionality and provide Feedback to the Company. This license does not permit Tester or its designated
    participants to use the Beta Products in any session intended primarily to provide general business training to
    other Tester associates, nor to any audiences outside of Tester or for any other commercial purpose. The Company
    reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, (i) revoke access and use of the Beta Products at any time, (ii)
    monitor or measure Tester’s use of the Beta Products, (iii) validate certain features or functionality of the Beta
    Products, and/or (iv) provide Beta Products or support necessary to maintain the Beta Products. Tester and/or its
    designated participants shall not and shall not attempt to directly or indirectly, (i) copy, modify, translate, or
    create derivative works of the Beta Products, (ii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to
    reconstruct, identify or discover any source code, underlying ideas, underlying user interface techniques, or
    algorithms of any part of the Beta Products, (iii) lend, lease, offer for sale, sell or otherwise use any part of
    the Beta Products for the benefit of any other third parties, or (iv) attempt to circumvent any license, timing or
    use restrictions that are built into any part of the Beta Products. However, any changes to the dispute resolution
    provisions set forth in Governing Law and Jurisdiction</a> will not apply to any
    disputes for which the parties have actual notice prior to the date the change is posted on the Beta Products.</p>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
  <p>Tester agrees to provide feedback, analysis, suggestions, enhancement requests, comments and recommendations to the
    Company regarding the Beta Products upon the Company’s request (the “<strong>Feedback</strong>”). Feedback shall
    include informing the Company about the performance, ease of use, features that may be missing, and any bugs
    encountered during the use of the Beta Products. The Company may contact Tester and Tester agrees to make available
    a reasonable amount of time to discuss the Beta Products with the Company if so requested. As between the Company
    and Tester, all right, title and interest in and to any such Feedback shall be owned solely and exclusively by the
    Company. Tester agrees that the Company shall have the perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide right to use, modify,
    license, sublicense and otherwise exploit all or part of the Feedback or any derivative thereof in any manner or
    media now known or hereafter devised without any remuneration, compensation or credit to Tester.</p>
